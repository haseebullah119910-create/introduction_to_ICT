    <h1>Introduction to Information & Communication Technology</h1>

    <!-- Three Informative Paragraphs -->
    <p>
        <strong>Information and Communication Technology (ICT)</strong> refers to all technologies 
        used to handle telecommunications, broadcast media, intelligent building management systems, 
        audio-visual processing, and network-based control. ICT helps people communicate and share 
        information quickly and easily. It plays a vital role in almost every field of life.
    </p>

    <p>
        ICT includes tools that allow us to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data. 
        These technologies help businesses, schools, and hospitals work more efficiently. 
        Modern ICT systems use <em>computers</em>, the internet, and smart devices to support 
        digital activities. ICT has made communication <small>faster and more reliable</small>.
    </p>

    <p>
        ICT also supports scientific work, such as writing chemical formulas like H<sub>2</sub>O 
        or mathematical expressions like x<sup>2</sup>. These technologies help students learn, 
        teachers teach, and professionals work more effectively in today’s digital world.
